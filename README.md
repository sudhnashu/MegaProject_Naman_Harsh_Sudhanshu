Project Overview: Streamlining School Bus Services

#Idea:

Our project aims to revolutionize school bus services by creating an efficient and user-friendly online platform. This platform incorporates domain-specific functionalities for bus scheduling, safety measures, user management, and features a parent/school portal. Additionally, it integrates domain-independent elements like authentication, database management, and UI/UX design.

#Achievements Thus Far:

1.Frontend Development:
Developed a user-friendly website with key pages, including the home page, payment page, student profile page, and driver profile page.

2.Optimal Route Calculation:
Implemented a function to determine the optimal bus route and calculate the cost for each student. This enhances efficiency in school bus services.

3.Robust Database Implementation:
Created a robust database to store essential details such as student information, bus details, driver profiles, route data, school information, and reservation details.

4.Google Maps Integration:
Utilized the Google Maps API to render maps, enhancing the overall user experience and providing real-time visualization.

#Code Execution:

To run the code sample, follow these steps:

For frontend:
npm run build
npm run dev

.For Python API:
flask --app main run

Note: Unfortunately, we couldn't provide the .env files as we encountered hosting challenges. We are actively working on resolving this issue.

#Future Enhancements:

We envision further polishing our project by:

1.Implementing additional features for enhanced safety and security.
2.Exploring hosting solutions to provide a seamless online experience.
3.Continuous UI/UX improvements based on user feedback.
Our commitment is to create a cutting-edge solution that not only streamlines school bus services but also sets a new standard for efficiency and user satisfaction in this domain. Thank you for your interest in our project!
